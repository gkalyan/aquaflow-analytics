# Demo Data Service Implementation

## Overview

Complete implementation of a production-quality Demo Data Service for AquaFlow Analytics that generates realistic SCADA data and provides visible ETL operations through the UI.

## Architecture

### Services Created

1. **demo-data-service** (`/source/AFA/demo-data-service/`)
   - Standalone Go service on port 8090
   - Generates realistic time-series data for 12 water infrastructure series
   - Provides paginated historical data and real-time endpoints

2. **etl-workers** (`/source/AFA/etl-workers/`)
   - Standalone ETL worker process
   - Polls database for ETL jobs and executes them
   - Supports historical_load and realtime_sync job types
   - Comprehensive logging to database

3. **Backend ETL API** (integrated into main backend)
   - `/api/etl/jobs` - List all ETL jobs
   - `/api/etl/jobs/:id` - Get job details
   - `/api/etl/jobs/:id/logs` - Get job logs (polling-based)
   - `/api/etl/jobs/:id/restart` - Restart failed jobs

4. **Frontend ETL Dashboard** 
   - Real-time job status monitoring
   - Live log streaming via polling
   - Job progress visualization
   - Restart failed jobs functionality

## Database Schema

### New Tables
- `etl_job_logs` - Stores all ETL operation logs
- Updated `etl_jobs` with job_type, parameters, schedule fields

### Sample Jobs Pre-configured
- Historical Load: Loads 2 months of data for all 12 series
- Real-time Sync: Syncs latest values every 30 seconds

## Demo Data Generated

### 12 Water Infrastructure Series:
1. Main Canal Flow Rate (800-1200 CFS, daily patterns)
2. Don Pedro Reservoir Level (780-820 ft, seasonal changes)
3. Pump Station 3 Pressure (40-60 PSI, operational cycles)
4. Main Canal Temperature (50-85°F, daily cycles)
5. Gate 12 Position (0-100%, operational)
6. Pump Station 1 Flow (300-700 CFS, operational)
7. North Branch Flow (200-600 CFS, daily patterns)
8. Water Quality pH (6.5-8.5, stable)
9. Pump Station 2 Status (boolean, operational)
10. Reservoir Inflow (800-1500 CFS, seasonal)
11. System Efficiency (70-95%, operational)
12. Turbidity Level (0.5-5.0 NTU, stable)

## Usage

### Start Services
```bash
# From aquaflow-analytics directory
docker-compose up -d

# This will start:
# - TimescaleDB (5432)
# - Redis (6379)  
# - Backend API (3000)
# - Frontend (5173)
# - Demo Data Service (8090)
# - ETL Workers
# - PgAdmin (8080)
```

### Apply Schema Updates
```sql
-- Run this in PgAdmin or psql
\i /path/to/010_etl_logs.sql
```

### Monitor ETL Operations
1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Login with admin/admin
3. Click "ETL Monitor" in sidebar
4. Watch real-time job execution and logs

### Manual ETL Job Creation
```sql
-- Historical load job (loads 2 months of data)
INSERT INTO aquaflow.etl_jobs (job_name, job_type, parameters, status) VALUES 
('Manual Historical Load', 'historical_load', 
'{
  "source_url": "http://demo-data-service:8090/api/historical",
  "start_date": "2025-04-23",
  "end_date": "2025-06-23", 
  "series_ids": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],
  "batch_size": 1000
}'::jsonb, 'pending');
```

## Features Implemented

✅ Realistic SCADA data generation with patterns
✅ Historical data loading with duplicate prevention
✅ Real-time data sync
✅ Comprehensive ETL logging to database
✅ Live log streaming in UI (1-second polling)
✅ Job status monitoring and progress tracking
✅ Failed job restart capability
✅ Production-ready architecture with proper error handling
✅ Docker integration for all services

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the data foundation needed for Phase 2 natural language query system. The ETL infrastructure is production-ready and can be adapted for real SCADA data sources.

Key benefits:
- Users can see data loading operations in real-time
- 2 months of realistic historical data for testing
- Ongoing real-time data for live queries
- Production-quality ETL monitoring and management
