# AquaFlow Analytics - Project Milestones & Progress

## Project Overview
**AquaFlow Analytics** is a Daily Operations Assistant for Water Districts, designed to help water operations managers (like Olivia) answer operational questions about their water infrastructure in seconds instead of hours through natural language queries.

**Target Impact**: Reduce question response time from 30 minutes to 30 seconds while maintaining 99.5% system uptime and <2 second query response times.

- **UI Library**: PrimeVue for enterprise-grade components

### Development Philosophy
- **Ship Daily**: Small, incremental improvements
- **Demo Quality**: Production-ready code from day one
- **User-Focused**: Optimized for water operations managers
- **Performance First**: Sub-2-second response times priority

### Key Risks & Mitigations
- **SCADA Integration Complexity**: Start with simulated data, build robust abstractions
- **Query Accuracy**: Begin with template-based approach, expand gradually
- **Performance**: Implement caching early, optimize database queries
- **User Adoption**: Focus on intuitive UI and immediate value delivery
